## Overview

We are going to start the Barney project by simulating a greeting robot in PyRoboSim.

PyRoboSim is a lightweight 2D mobile robot simulator for behaviour prototyping. We use PyRoboSim to create a custom world of each of the BARN building floors using a BARN floor plan. It includes defining the office rooms and studios, hallways, some locations and objects from pick-and-place tasks. We use the PyRoboSim demo robot. To control the robots, we can use the GUI, python scripts or ROS actions/services.

The first step is to give a tour of the BARN Tech Lab.

## Installation

The native installation for this project is on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) with ROS2 Humble. You can find information about these platforms at:

- https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/
- https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

There are installation instructions for [Ubuntu](./INSTALL_Ubuntu.md), [MAC](./INSTALL_MAC.md) and [Windows](./INSTALL_Windows.md). For MAC and Ubuntu, you will use a Docker virtual environment. Windows will use WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux).

## Usage

- **TBD**

## Contributions

To contribute to this repository, you must first clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BainbridgeArtisanResourceNetwork/Barney.git

```
We recommend that you create a new branch for your work, and merge your changes into main when you are confident that the changes are tested and working.

Another way to work from this repository is to fork it, and then clone your fork. That will allow you to work independently within your repository, and if you want to contribute back to this original repository, you can open a Pull Request of your changes back to here. There is further documentation on this process here: [Collaborating with Pull Requests and Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

We strongly recommend that you use the Docker images on both Ubuntu and MAC. This will require you to learn and install Docker. See https://docs.docker.com/get-started/. We also provide a 'local setup' for both when developing on Windows and running on Robot hardware (Raspberry Pi).
