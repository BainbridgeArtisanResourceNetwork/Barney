## Overview

PyRoboSim is a lightweight 2D mobile robot simulator for behaviour prototyping. In this project, we use PyRoboSim to create a custom world of the BARN building using its floor plan. It includes defining the office rooms and studios, hallways, some locations and objects from pick-and-place tasks and robots (IDOGs). We use the PyRoboSim demo robot. To control the robots, we can use the GUI, python scripts or ROS actions/services.

## Demo

TBD

## Features

- **Build complex worlds** using the world modeling framework, both manually and programmatically.

- **Define custom actions and action executors** (e.g., path planning/following or decision-making algorithms).

- **Design task and motion planners** that go from task specification to an executable plan.

- **Export worlds to Gazebo** to test in a 3D world with more complex sensing and actuation models.
